  summary: Package for numerical quantum transport calculations.
  description: |
    Kwant is a free (open source) Python package for numerical calculations on
    tight-binding models with a strong focus on quantum transport. It is designed to
    be flexible and easy to use. Thanks to the use of innovative algorithms, Kwant
    is often faster than other available codes, even those entirely written in the
    low level FORTRAN and C/C++ languages.
